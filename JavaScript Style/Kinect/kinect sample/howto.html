This kinect app allows the users to learn more about the mechanics of polynomial graphs. The user needs to stand in front of the kinect and identify their hands on the screen. From there the users needs to use their open hand and close it on the point of the graph they want to adjust. They then drag their hand and release when they want to. Once hand is released the new graph is shown as well as new information with respect to the newly drawn graph
